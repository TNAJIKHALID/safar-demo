## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TNAJIKHALID/safar-demo/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Development stepS
1. split safar project into small components

2. add every component into a maven project

3. specify the component's version for instances safar-pos-tagger:1.0.0

4. apply VSC (Git/Github)

5. integrate Spring Framework (Spring Rest) in order to make the component available as a Rest Api

6. create a pipeline for maven life cycles (clean-build-test-package)

7. create a container of the component using docker (create Dockerfile)

8. create a pipeline using Github Actions (build-test-code analysis- deployment on a remote repository)

9. describe usage of the component using Github pages


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TNAJIKHALID/safar-demo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
